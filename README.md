Stable: [v1.7.1](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/releases/tag/v1.7.1) / [Roadmap | F.A.Q.](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/discussions/126)

High-performance inference of [OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) automatic speech recognition (ASR) model:

- Plain C/C++ implementation without dependencies
- Apple Silicon first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate framework, Metal and [Core ML](#core-ml-support)
- AVX intrinsics support for x86 architectures
- VSX intrinsics support for POWER architectures
- Mixed F16 / F32 precision
- [4-bit and 5-bit integer quantization support](#quantization)
- Zero memory allocations at runtime
- [Vulkan support](#vulkan-gpu-support)
- Support for CPU-only inference
- [Efficient GPU support for NVIDIA](#nvidia-gpu-support)
- [OpenVINO Support](#openvino-support)
- [Ascend NPU Support](#ascend-npu-support)
- [C-style API](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/include/whisper.h)

Supported platforms:

- [x] Mac OS (Intel and Arm)
- [x] [iOS](examples/whisper.objc)
- [x] [Android](examples/whisper.android)
- [x] [Java](bindings/java/README.md)
- [x] Linux / [FreeBSD](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/56#issuecomment-1350920264)
- [x] [WebAssembly](examples/whisper.wasm)
- [x] Windows ([MSVC](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml#L117-L144) and [MinGW](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/168)]
- [x] [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/discussions/166)
- [x] [Docker](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/pkgs/container/whisper.cpp)

The entire high-level implementation of the model is contained in [whisper.h](include/whisper.h) and [whisper.cpp](src/whisper.cpp).
The rest of the code is part of the [`ggml`](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) machine learning library.

Having such a lightweight implementation of the model allows to easily integrate it in different platforms and applications.
As an example, here is a video of running the model on an iPhone 13 device - fully offline, on-device: [whisper.objc](examples/whisper.objc)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/197385372-962a6dea-bca1-4d50-bf96-1d8c27b98c81.mp4

You can also easily make your own offline voice assistant application: [command](examples/command)

Or you can even run it straight in the browser: [talk.wasm](examples/talk.wasm)

## Implementation details

- The core tensor operations are implemented in C ([ggml.h](ggml/include/ggml.h) / [ggml.c](ggml/src/ggml.c))
- The transformer model and the high-level C-style API are implemented in C++ ([whisper.h](include/whisper.h) / [whisper.cpp](src/whisper.cpp))
- Sample usage is demonstrated in [main.cpp](examples/main)
- Sample real-time audio transcription from the microphone is demonstrated in [stream.cpp](examples/stream)
- Various other examples are available in the [examples](examples) folder

The tensor operators are optimized heavily for Apple silicon CPUs. Depending on the computation size, Arm Neon SIMD intrinsics or CBLAS Accelerate framework routines are used. The latter are especially effective for bigger sizes since the Accelerate framework utilizes the special-purpose AMX coprocessor available in modern Apple products.

## Quick start

First clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp.git
```

Navigate into the directory:

```
cd whisper.cpp
```

Then, download one of the Whisper [models](models/README.md) converted in [`ggml` format](#ggml-format). For example:

```bash
sh ./models/download-ggml-model.sh base.en
```

Now build the [main](examples/main) example and transcribe an audio file like this:

```bash
# build the main example
make -j

# transcribe an audio file
./main -f samples/jfk.wav
```

---

For a quick demo, simply run `make base.en`:

```text
$ make -j base.en

The command downloads the `base.en` model converted to custom `ggml` format and runs the inference on all `.wav` samples in the folder `samples`.

For detailed usage instructions, run: `./main -h`

Note that the [main](examples/main) example currently runs only with 16-bit WAV files, so make sure to convert your input before running the tool.
For example, you can use `ffmpeg` like this:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav
```

## More audio samples

If you want some extra audio samples to play with, simply run:

```
make -j samples
```

This will download a few more audio files from Wikipedia and convert them to 16-bit WAV format via `ffmpeg`.

You can download and run the other models as follows:

```
make -j tiny.en
make -j tiny
make -j base.en
make -j base
make -j small.en
make -j small
make -j medium.en
make -j medium
make -j large-v1
make -j large-v2
make -j large-v3
make -j large-v3-turbo
```

## Memory usage

| Model  | Disk    | Mem     |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| tiny   | 75 MiB  | ~273 MB |
| base   | 142 MiB | ~388 MB |
| small  | 466 MiB | ~852 MB |
| medium | 1.5 GiB | ~2.1 GB |
| large  | 2.9 GiB | ~3.9 GB |

## Quantization

`whisper.cpp` supports integer quantization of the Whisper `ggml` models.
Quantized models require less memory and disk space and depending on the hardware can be processed more efficiently.

Here are the steps for creating and using a quantized model:

```bash
# quantize a model with Q5_0 method
make -j quantize
./quantize models/ggml-base.en.bin models/ggml-base.en-q5_0.bin q5_0

# run the examples as usual, specifying the quantized model file
./main -m models/ggml-base.en-q5_0.bin ./samples/gb0.wav
```

## Core ML support

On Apple Silicon devices, the Encoder inference can be executed on the Apple Neural Engine (ANE) via Core ML. This can result in significant
speed-up - more than x3 faster compared with CPU-only execution. Here are the instructions for generating a Core ML model and using it with `whisper.cpp`:

- Install Python dependencies needed for the creation of the Core ML model:

  ```bash
  pip install ane_transformers
  pip install openai-whisper
  pip install coremltools
  ```

  - To ensure `coremltools` operates correctly, please confirm that [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is installed and execute `xcode-select --install` to install the command-line tools.
  - Python 3.10 is recommended.
  - MacOS Sonoma (version 14) or newer is recommended, as older versions of MacOS might experience issues with transcription hallucination.
  - [OPTIONAL] It is recommended to utilize a Python version management system, such as [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for this step:
    - To create an environment, use: `conda create -n py310-whisper python=3.10 -y`
    - To activate the environment, use: `conda activate py310-whisper`

- Generate a Core ML model. For example, to generate a `base.en` model, use:

  ```bash
  ./models/generate-coreml-model.sh base.en
  ```

  This will generate the folder `models/ggml-base.en-encoder.mlmodelc`

- Build `whisper.cpp` with Core ML support:

  ```bash
  # using Makefile
  make clean
  WHISPER_COREML=1 make -j

  # using CMake
  cmake -B build -DWHISPER_COREML=1
  cmake --build build -j --config Release
  ```

- Run the examples as usual. For example:

  ```text
  $ ./main -m models/ggml-base.en.bin -f samples/jfk.wav

  ...

  whisper_init_state: loading Core ML model from 'models/ggml-base.en-encoder.mlmodelc'
  whisper_init_state: first run on a device may take a while ...
  whisper_init_state: Core ML model loaded

  system_info: n_threads = 4 / 10 | AVX = 0 | AVX2 = 0 | AVX512 = 0 | FMA = 0 | NEON = 1 | ARM_FMA = 1 | F16C = 0 | FP16_VA = 1 | WASM_SIMD = 0 | BLAS = 1 | SSE3 = 0 | VSX = 0 | COREML = 1 |

  ...
  ```

  The first run on a device is slow, since the ANE service compiles the Core ML model to some device-specific format.
  Next runs are faster.

For more information about the Core ML implementation please refer to PR [#566](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/pull/566).

## OpenVINO support

On platforms that support [OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino), the Encoder inference can be executed
on OpenVINO-supported devices including x86 CPUs and Intel GPUs (integrated & discrete).

This can result in significant speedup in encoder performance. Here are the instructions for generating the OpenVINO model and using it with `whisper.cpp`:

- First, setup python virtual env. and install python dependencies. Python 3.10 is recommended.

  Windows:

  ```powershell
  cd models
  python -m venv openvino_conv_env
  openvino_conv_env\Scripts\activate
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements-openvino.txt
  ```

  Linux and macOS:

  ```bash
  cd models
  python3 -m venv openvino_conv_env
  source openvino_conv_env/bin/activate
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements-openvino.txt
  ```

- Generate an OpenVINO encoder model. For example, to generate a `base.en` model, use:

  ```
  python convert-whisper-to-openvino.py --model base.en
  ```

  This will produce ggml-base.en-encoder-openvino.xml/.bin IR model files. It's recommended to relocate these to the same folder as `ggml` models, as that
  is the default location that the OpenVINO extension will search at runtime.

- Build `whisper.cpp` with OpenVINO support:

  Download OpenVINO package from [release page](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/releases). The recommended version to use is [2023.0.0](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/releases/tag/2023.0.0).

  After downloading & extracting package onto your development system, set up required environment by sourcing setupvars script. For example:

  Linux:

  ```bash
  source /path/to/l_openvino_toolkit_ubuntu22_2023.0.0.10926.b4452d56304_x86_64/setupvars.sh
  ```

  Windows (cmd):

  ```powershell
  C:\Path\To\w_openvino_toolkit_windows_2023.0.0.10926.b4452d56304_x86_64\setupvars.bat
  ```

  And then build the project using cmake:

  ```bash
  cmake -B build -DWHISPER_OPENVINO=1
  cmake --build build -j --config Release
  ```

- Run the examples as usual. For example:

  ```text
  $ ./main -m models/ggml-base.en.bin -f samples/jfk.wav

  ...

  whisper_ctx_init_openvino_encoder: loading OpenVINO model from 'models/ggml-base.en-encoder-openvino.xml'
  whisper_ctx_init_openvino_encoder: first run on a device may take a while ...
  whisper_openvino_init: path_model = models/ggml-base.en-encoder-openvino.xml, device = GPU, cache_dir = models/ggml-base.en-encoder-openvino-cache
  whisper_ctx_init_openvino_encoder: OpenVINO model loaded

  system_info: n_threads = 4 / 8 | AVX = 1 | AVX2 = 1 | AVX512 = 0 | FMA = 1 | NEON = 0 | ARM_FMA = 0 | F16C = 1 | FP16_VA = 0 | WASM_SIMD = 0 | BLAS = 0 | SSE3 = 1 | VSX = 0 | COREML = 0 | OPENVINO = 1 |

  ...
  ```

  The first time run on an OpenVINO device is slow, since the OpenVINO framework will compile the IR (Intermediate Representation) model to a device-specific 'blob'. This device-specific blob will get
  cached for the next run.

For more information about the Core ML implementation please refer to PR [#1037](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/pull/1037).

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   My fellow Americans, this day has brought terrible news and great sadness to our country.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   At nine o'clock this morning, Mission Control in Houston lost contact with our Space Shuttle Columbia.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   A short time later, debris was seen falling from the skies above Texas.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   The Columbia's lost. There are no survivors.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   On board was a crew of seven.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Colonel Rick Husband, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Anderson, Commander Laurel Clark,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Captain David Brown, Commander William McCool, Dr. Kultna Shavla, and Ilan Ramon,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   a colonel in the Israeli Air Force.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   These men and women assumed great risk in the service to all humanity.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   In an age when space flight has come to seem almost routine,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   it is easy to overlook the dangers of travel by rocket
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and the difficulties of navigating the fierce outer atmosphere of the Earth.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   These astronauts knew the dangers, and they faced them willingly,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   knowing they had a high and noble purpose in life.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Because of their courage and daring and idealism, we will miss them all the more.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   All Americans today are thinking as well of the families of these men and women
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   who have been given this sudden shock and grief.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   You're not alone. Our entire nation grieves with you,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and those you love will always have the respect and gratitude of this country.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   The cause in which they died will continue.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Mankind is led into the darkness beyond our world by the inspiration of discovery
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and the longing to understand. Our journey into space will go on.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   In the skies today, we saw destruction and tragedy.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Yet farther than we can see, there is comfort and hope.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   In the words of the prophet Isaiah, "Lift your eyes and look to the heavens
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   who created all these. He who brings out the starry hosts one by one
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and calls them each by name."
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   The same Creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   The crew of the shuttle Columbia did not return safely to earth,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   yet we can pray that all are safely home.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   May God bless the grieving families, and may God continue to bless America.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   [Silence]

## Real-time audio input example

This is a naive example of performing real-time inference on audio from your microphone.
The [stream](examples/stream) tool samples the audio every half a second and runs the transcription continuously.
More info is available in [issue #10](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/10).

```bash
make stream -j
./stream -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -t 8 --step 500 --length 5000
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/194935793-76afede7-cfa8-48d8-a80f-28ba83be7d09.mp4

## Confidence color-coding

Adding the `--print-colors` argument will print the transcribed text using an experimental color coding strategy
to highlight words with high or low confidence:

```bash
./main -m models/ggml-base.en.bin -f samples/gb0.wav --print-colors
```

<img width="965" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/197356445-311c8643-9397-4e5e-b46e-0b4b4daa2530.png">

## Controlling the length of the generated text segments (experimental)

For example, to limit the line length to a maximum of 16 characters, simply add `-ml 16`:

```text
$ ./main -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/jfk.wav -ml 16

whisper_model_load: loading model from './models/ggml-base.en.bin'
...
system_info: n_threads = 4 / 10 | AVX2 = 0 | AVX512 = 0 | NEON = 1 | FP16_VA = 1 | WASM_SIMD = 0 | BLAS = 1 |

main: processing './samples/jfk.wav' (176000 samples, 11.0 sec), 4 threads, 1 processors, lang = en, task = transcribe, timestamps = 1 ...

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850]   And so my
[00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.590]   fellow
[00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.140]   Americans, ask
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.660]   not what your
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.840]   country can do
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.430]   for you, ask
[00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.440]   what you can do
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.020]   for your
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.000]   country.
```

## Word-level timestamp (experimental)

The `--max-len` argument can be used to obtain word-level timestamps. Simply use `-ml 1`:

```text
$ ./main -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/jfk.wav -ml 1

whisper_model_load: loading model from './models/ggml-base.en.bin'
...
system_info: n_threads = 4 / 10 | AVX2 = 0 | AVX512 = 0 | NEON = 1 | FP16_VA = 1 | WASM_SIMD = 0 | BLAS = 1 |

main: processing './samples/jfk.wav' (176000 samples, 11.0 sec), 4 threads, 1 processors, lang = en, task = transcribe, timestamps = 1 ...

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320]
[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.370]   And
[00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:00.690]   so
[00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:00.850]   my
[00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.590]   fellow
[00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.850]   Americans
[00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.300]  ,
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.140]   ask
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.990]   not
[00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.410]   what
[00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.660]   your
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.260]   country
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.600]   can
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:06.840]   do
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.010]   for
[00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.170]   you
[00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.190]  ,
[00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.430]   ask
[00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.910]   what
[00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.040]   you
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.320]   can
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.440]   do
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.760]   for
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.020]   your
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.510]   country
[00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.000]  .
```

## Speaker segmentation via tinydiarize (experimental)

More information about this approach is available here: https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/pull/1058

Sample usage:

```py
# download a tinydiarize compatible model
./models/download-ggml-model.sh small.en-tdrz

# run as usual, adding the "-tdrz" command-line argument
./main -f ./samples/a13.wav -m ./models/ggml-small.en-tdrz.bin -tdrz
...
main: processing './samples/a13.wav' (480000 samples, 30.0 sec), 4 threads, 1 processors, lang = en, task = transcribe, tdrz = 1, timestamps = 1 ...
...
[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   Okay Houston, we've had a problem here. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.200]   This is Houston. Say again please. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.260]   Uh Houston we've had a problem.
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.320]   We've had a main beam up on a volt. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.820]   Roger main beam interval. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.100]   Uh uh [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.020]   So okay stand, by thirteen we're looking at it. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.740]   Okay uh right now uh Houston the uh voltage is uh is looking good um.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.940]   And we had a a pretty large bank or so.
```

## Karaoke-style movie generation (experimental)

The [main](examples/main) example provides support for output of karaoke-style movies, where the
currently pronounced word is highlighted. Use the `-wts` argument and run the generated bash script.
This requires to have `ffmpeg` installed.

Here are a few _"typical"_ examples:

```bash
./main -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/jfk.wav -owts
source ./samples/jfk.wav.wts
ffplay ./samples/jfk.wav.mp4
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/199337465-dbee4b5e-9aeb-48a3-b1c6-323ac4db5b2c.mp4

---

```bash
./main -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/mm0.wav -owts
source ./samples/mm0.wav.wts
ffplay ./samples/mm0.wav.mp4
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/199337504-cc8fd233-0cb7-4920-95f9-4227de3570aa.mp4

---

```bash
./main -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/gb0.wav -owts
source ./samples/gb0.wav.wts
ffplay ./samples/gb0.wav.mp4
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/199337538-b7b0c7a3-2753-4a88-a0cd-f28a317987ba.mp4

---

## Video comparison of different models

Use the [scripts/bench-wts.sh](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/scripts/bench-wts.sh) script to generate a video in the following format:

```bash
./scripts/bench-wts.sh samples/jfk.wav
ffplay ./samples/jfk.wav.all.mp4
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/223206245-2d36d903-cf8e-4f09-8c3b-eb9f9c39d6fc.mp4

---

## Benchmarks

In order to have an objective comparison of the performance of the inference across different system configurations,
use the [bench](examples/bench) tool. The tool simply runs the Encoder part of the model and prints how much time it
took to execute it. The results are summarized in the following Github issue:

[Benchmark results](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/89)

Additionally a script to run whisper.cpp with different models and audio files is provided [bench.py](scripts/bench.py).

You can run it with the following command, by default it will run against any standard model in the models folder.

```bash
python3 scripts/bench.py -f samples/jfk.wav -t 2,4,8 -p 1,2
```

It is written in python with the intention of being easy to modify and extend for your benchmarking use case.

It outputs a csv file with the results of the benchmarking.

## `ggml` format

The original models are converted to a custom binary format. This allows to pack everything needed into a single file:

- model parameters
- mel filters
- vocabulary
- weights

You can download the converted models using the [models/download-ggml-model.sh](models/download-ggml-model.sh) script
or manually from here:

- https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp
- https://ggml.ggerganov.com

For more details, see the conversion script [models/convert-pt-to-ggml.py](models/convert-pt-to-ggml.py) or [models/README.md](models/README.md).
