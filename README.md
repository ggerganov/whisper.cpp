- [x] [iOS](examples/whisper.objc)
- [x] [Android](examples/whisper.android)
- [x] [Java](bindings/java/README.md)
- [x] Linux / [FreeBSD](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/56#issuecomment-1350920264)
- [x] [WebAssembly](examples/whisper.wasm)
- [x] Windows ([MSVC](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml#L117-L144) and [MinGW](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/168)]
- [x] [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/discussions/166)
- [x] [Docker](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/pkgs/container/whisper.cpp)

The entire high-level implementation of the model is contained in [whisper.h](include/whisper.h) and [whisper.cpp](src/whisper.cpp).
The rest of the code is part of the [`ggml`](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) machine learning library.

Having such a lightweight implementation of the model allows to easily integrate it in different platforms and applications.
As an example, here is a video of running the model on an iPhone 13 device - fully offline, on-device: [whisper.objc](examples/whisper.objc)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/197385372-962a6dea-bca1-4d50-bf96-1d8c27b98c81.mp4

You can also easily make your own offline voice assistant application: [command](examples/command)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/204038393-2f846eae-c255-4099-a76d-5735c25c49da.mp4

On Apple Silicon, the inference runs fully on the GPU via Metal:

https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/assets/1991296/c82e8f86-60dc-49f2-b048-d2fdbd6b5225

## Quick start

First clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp.git
```

Navigate into the directory:

```
cd whisper.cpp
```

Then, download one of the Whisper [models](models/README.md) converted in [`ggml` format](#ggml-format). For example:

```bash
sh ./models/download-ggml-model.sh base.en
```

Now build the [whisper-cli](examples/cli) example and transcribe an audio file like this:

```bash
# build the project
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release

# transcribe an audio file
./build/bin/whisper-cli -f samples/jfk.wav
```

---

For a quick demo, simply run `make base.en`.

The command downloads the `base.en` model converted to custom `ggml` format and runs the inference on all `.wav` samples in the folder `samples`.

For detailed usage instructions, run: `./build/bin/whisper-cli -h`

Note that the [whisper-cli](examples/cli) example currently runs only with 16-bit WAV files, so make sure to convert your input before running the tool.
For example, you can use `ffmpeg` like this:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav
```

## More audio samples

If you want some extra audio samples to play with, simply run:

```
make -j samples
```

This will download a few more audio files from Wikipedia and convert them to 16-bit WAV format via `ffmpeg`.

You can download and run the other models as follows:

```
make -j tiny.en
make -j tiny
make -j base.en
make -j base
make -j small.en
make -j small
make -j medium.en
make -j medium
make -j large-v1
make -j large-v2
make -j large-v3
make -j large-v3-turbo
```

## Memory usage

| Model  | Disk    | Mem     |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| tiny   | 75 MiB  | ~273 MB |
| base   | 142 MiB | ~388 MB |
| small  | 466 MiB | ~852 MB |
| medium | 1.5 GiB | ~2.1 GB |
| large  | 2.9 GiB | ~3.9 GB |

## Quantization

`whisper.cpp` supports integer quantization of the Whisper `ggml` models.
Quantized models require less memory and disk space and depending on the hardware can be processed more efficiently.

Here are the steps for creating and using a quantized model:

```bash
# quantize a model with Q5_0 method
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
./build/bin/quantize models/ggml-base.en.bin models/ggml-base.en-q5_0.bin q5_0

# run the examples as usual, specifying the quantized model file
./build/bin/whisper-cli -m models/ggml-base.en-q5_0.bin ./samples/gb0.wav
```

## Core ML support

On Apple Silicon devices, the Encoder inference can be executed on the Apple Neural Engine (ANE) via Core ML. This can result in significant
speed-up - more than x3 faster compared with CPU-only execution. Here are the instructions for generating a Core ML model and using it with `whisper.cpp`:

- Install Python dependencies needed for the creation of the Core ML model:

  ```bash
  pip install ane_transformers
  pip install openai-whisper
  pip install coremltools
  ```

  - To ensure `coremltools` operates correctly, please confirm that [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is installed and execute `xcode-select --install` to install the command-line tools.
  - Python 3.10 is recommended.
  - MacOS Sonoma (version 14) or newer is recommended, as older versions of MacOS might experience issues with transcription hallucination.
  - [OPTIONAL] It is recommended to utilize a Python version management system, such as [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for this step:
    - To create an environment, use: `conda create -n py310-whisper python=3.10 -y`
    - To activate the environment, use: `conda activate py310-whisper`

- Generate a Core ML model. For example, to generate a `base.en` model, use:

  ```bash
  ./models/generate-coreml-model.sh base.en
  ```

  This will generate the folder `models/ggml-base.en-encoder.mlmodelc`

- Build `whisper.cpp` with Core ML support:

  ```bash
  # using CMake
  cmake -B build -DWHISPER_COREML=1
  cmake --build build -j --config Release
  ```

- Run the examples as usual. For example:

  ```text
  $ ./build/bin/whisper-cli -m models/ggml-base.en.bin -f samples/jfk.wav

  ...

  whisper_init_state: loading Core ML model from 'models/ggml-base.en-encoder.mlmodelc'
  whisper_init_state: first run on a device may take a while ...
  whisper_init_state: Core ML model loaded

  system_info: n_threads = 4 / 10 | AVX = 0 | AVX2 = 0 | AVX512 = 0 | FMA = 0 | NEON = 1 | ARM_FMA = 1 | F16C = 0 | FP16_VA = 1 | WASM_SIMD = 0 | BLAS = 1 | SSE3 = 0 | VSX = 0 | COREML = 1 |

  ...
  ```

  The first run on a device is slow, since the ANE service compiles the Core ML model to some device-specific format.
  Next runs are faster.

For more information about the Core ML implementation please refer to PR [#566](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/pull/566).

## OpenVINO support

On platforms that support [OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino), the Encoder inference can be executed
on OpenVINO-supported devices including x86 CPUs and Intel GPUs (integrated & discrete).

This can result in significant speedup in encoder performance. Here are the instructions for generating the OpenVINO model and using it with `whisper.cpp`:

- First, setup python virtual env. and install python dependencies. Python 3.10 is recommended.

  Windows:

  ```powershell
  cd models
  python -m venv openvino_conv_env
  openvino_conv_env\Scripts\activate
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements-openvino.txt
  ```

  Linux and macOS:

  ```bash
  cd models
  python3 -m venv openvino_conv_env
  source openvino_conv_env/bin/activate
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements-openvino.txt
  ```

- Generate an OpenVINO encoder model. For example, to generate a `base.en` model, use:

  ```
  python convert-whisper-to-openvino.py --model base.en
  ```

  This will produce ggml-base.en-encoder-openvino.xml/.bin IR model files. It's recommended to relocate these to the same folder as `ggml` models, as that
  is the default location that the OpenVINO extension will search at runtime.

- Build `whisper.cpp` with OpenVINO support:

  Download OpenVINO package from [release page](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/releases). The recommended version to use is [2023.0.0](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/releases/tag/2023.0.0).

  After downloading & extracting package onto your development system, set up required environment by sourcing setupvars script. For example:

  Linux:

  ```bash
  source /path/to/l_openvino_toolkit_ubuntu22_2023.0.0.10926.b4452d56304_x86_64/setupvars.sh
  ```

  Windows (cmd):

  ```powershell
  C:\Path\To\w_openvino_toolkit_windows_2023.0.0.10926.b4452d56304_x86_64\setupvars.bat
  ```

  And then build the project using cmake:

  ```bash
  cmake -B build -DWHISPER_OPENVINO=1
  cmake --build build -j --config Release
  ```

- Run the examples as usual. For example:

  ```text
  $ ./build/bin/whisper-cli -m models/ggml-base.en.bin -f samples/jfk.wav

  ...

  whisper_ctx_init_openvino_encoder: loading OpenVINO model from 'models/ggml-base.en-encoder-openvino.xml'
  whisper_ctx_init_openvino_encoder: first run on a device may take a while ...
  whisper_openvino_init: path_model = models/ggml-base.en-encoder-openvino.xml, device = GPU, cache_dir = models/ggml-base.en-encoder-openvino-cache
  whisper_ctx_init_openvino_encoder: OpenVINO model loaded

  system_info: n_threads = 4 / 8 | AVX = 1 | AVX2 = 1 | AVX512 = 0 | FMA = 1 | NEON = 0 | ARM_FMA = 0 | F16C = 1 | FP16_VA = 0 | WASM_SIMD = 0 | BLAS = 0 | SSE3 = 1 | VSX = 0 | COREML = 0 | OPENVINO = 1 |

  ...
  ```

  The first time run on an OpenVINO device is slow, since the OpenVINO framework will compile the IR (Intermediate Representation) model to a device-specific 'blob'. This device-specific blob will get
  cached for the next run.

For more information about the Core ML implementation please refer to PR [#1037](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/pull/1037).

## NVIDIA GPU support

With NVIDIA cards the processing of the models is done efficiently on the GPU via cuBLAS and custom CUDA kernels.
First, make sure you have installed `cuda`: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

Now build `whisper.cpp` with CUDA support:

```
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=1
cmake --build build -j --config Release
```

## Vulkan GPU support
Cross-vendor solution which allows you to accelerate workload on your GPU.
First, make sure your graphics card driver provides support for Vulkan API.

Now build `whisper.cpp` with Vulkan support:
```
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=1
cmake --build build -j --config Release
```

## BLAS CPU support via OpenBLAS

Encoder processing can be accelerated on the CPU via OpenBLAS.
First, make sure you have installed `openblas`: https://www.openblas.net/

Now build `whisper.cpp` with OpenBLAS support:

```
cmake -B build -DGGML_BLAS=1
cmake --build build -j --config Release
```

## Ascend NPU support

Ascend NPU provides inference acceleration via [`CANN`](https://www.hiascend.com/en/software/cann) and AI cores.

First, check if your Ascend NPU device is supported:

**Verified devices**
| Ascend NPU                    | Status  |
|:-----------------------------:|:-------:|
| Atlas 300T A2                 | Support |

Then, make sure you have installed [`CANN toolkit`](https://www.hiascend.com/en/software/cann/community) . The lasted version of CANN is recommanded.

Now build `whisper.cpp` with CANN support:

```
cmake -B build -DGGML_CANN=1
cmake --build build -j --config Release
```

Run the inference examples as usual, for example:

```
./build/bin/whisper-cli -f samples/jfk.wav -m models/ggml-base.en.bin -t 8
```

*Notes:*

- If you have trouble with Ascend NPU device, please create a issue with **[CANN]** prefix/tag.
- If you run successfully with your Ascend NPU device, please help update the table `Verified devices`.

## Installing with Conan

You can install pre-built binaries for whisper.cpp or build it from source using [Conan](https://conan.io/). Use the following command:

```
conan install --requires="whisper-cpp/[*]" --build=missing
```

For detailed instructions on how to use Conan, please refer to the [Conan documentation](https://docs.conan.io/2/).

## Limitations

- Inference only

## Real-time audio input example

This is a naive example of performing real-time inference on audio from your microphone.
The [stream](examples/stream) tool samples the audio every half a second and runs the transcription continuously.
More info is available in [issue #10](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/10).

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
./build/bin/stream -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -t 8 --step 500 --length 5000
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/194935793-76afede7-cfa8-48d8-a80f-28ba83be7d09.mp4

## Confidence color-coding

Adding the `--print-colors` argument will print the transcribed text using an experimental color coding strategy
to highlight words with high or low confidence:

```bash
./build/bin/whisper-cli -m models/ggml-base.en.bin -f samples/gb0.wav --print-colors
```

<img width="965" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/197356445-311c8643-9397-4e5e-b46e-0b4b4daa2530.png">

## Controlling the length of the generated text segments (experimental)

For example, to limit the line length to a maximum of 16 characters, simply add `-ml 16`:

```text
$ ./build/bin/whisper-cli -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/jfk.wav -ml 16

whisper_model_load: loading model from './models/ggml-base.en.bin'
...
system_info: n_threads = 4 / 10 | AVX2 = 0 | AVX512 = 0 | NEON = 1 | FP16_VA = 1 | WASM_SIMD = 0 | BLAS = 1 |

main: processing './samples/jfk.wav' (176000 samples, 11.0 sec), 4 threads, 1 processors, lang = en, task = transcribe, timestamps = 1 ...

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850]   And so my
[00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.590]   fellow
[00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.140]   Americans, ask
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.660]   not what your
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.840]   country can do
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.430]   for you, ask
[00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.440]   what you can do
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.020]   for your
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.000]   country.
```

## Word-level timestamp (experimental)

The `--max-len` argument can be used to obtain word-level timestamps. Simply use `-ml 1`:

```text
$ ./build/bin/whisper-cli -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/jfk.wav -ml 1

whisper_model_load: loading model from './models/ggml-base.en.bin'
...
system_info: n_threads = 4 / 10 | AVX2 = 0 | AVX512 = 0 | NEON = 1 | FP16_VA = 1 | WASM_SIMD = 0 | BLAS = 1 |

main: processing './samples/jfk.wav' (176000 samples, 11.0 sec), 4 threads, 1 processors, lang = en, task = transcribe, timestamps = 1 ...

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320]
[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.370]   And
[00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:00.690]   so

[00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.590]   fellow
[00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.850]   Americans
[00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.300]  ,
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.140]   ask
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.990]   not
[00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.410]   what
[00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.660]   your
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.260]   country
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.600]   can
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:06.840]   do
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.010]   for
[00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.170]   you
[00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.190]  ,
[00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.430]   ask
[00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.910]   what
[00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.040]   you
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.320]   can
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.440]   do
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.760]   for
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.020]   your
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.510]   country
[00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.000]  .
```

## Speaker segmentation via tinydiarize (experimental)

More information about this approach is available here: https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/pull/1058

Sample usage:

```py
# download a tinydiarize compatible model
./models/download-ggml-model.sh small.en-tdrz

# run as usual, adding the "-tdrz" command-line argument
./build/bin/whisper-cli -f ./samples/a13.wav -m ./models/ggml-small.en-tdrz.bin -tdrz
...
main: processing './samples/a13.wav' (480000 samples, 30.0 sec), 4 threads, 1 processors, lang = en, task = transcribe, tdrz = 1, timestamps = 1 ...
...
[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   Okay Houston, we've had a problem here. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.200]   This is Houston. Say again please. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.260]   Uh Houston we've had a problem.
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.320]   We've had a main beam up on a volt. [SPEAKER_TURN]

[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.020]   So okay stand, by thirteen we're looking at it. [SPEAKER_TURN]
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.740]   Okay uh right now uh Houston the uh voltage is uh is looking good um.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.940]   And we had a a pretty large bank or so.
```

## Karaoke-style movie generation (experimental)

The [whisper-cli](examples/cli) example provides support for output of karaoke-style movies, where the
currently pronounced word is highlighted. Use the `-wts` argument and run the generated bash script.
This requires to have `ffmpeg` installed.

Here are a few _"typical"_ examples:

```bash
./build/bin/whisper-cli -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/jfk.wav -owts
source ./samples/jfk.wav.wts
ffplay ./samples/jfk.wav.mp4
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/199337465-dbee4b5e-9aeb-48a3-b1c6-323ac4db5b2c.mp4

---

```bash
./build/bin/whisper-cli -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/mm0.wav -owts
source ./samples/mm0.wav.wts
ffplay ./samples/mm0.wav.mp4
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/199337504-cc8fd233-0cb7-4920-95f9-4227de3570aa.mp4

---

```bash
./build/bin/whisper-cli -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/gb0.wav -owts
source ./samples/gb0.wav.wts
ffplay ./samples/gb0.wav.mp4
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/199337538-b7b0c7a3-2753-4a88-a0cd-f28a317987ba.mp4

---

## Video comparison of different models

Use the [scripts/bench-wts.sh](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/scripts/bench-wts.sh) script to generate a video in the following format:

```bash
./scripts/bench-wts.sh samples/jfk.wav
ffplay ./samples/jfk.wav.all.mp4
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/223206245-2d36d903-cf8e-4f09-8c3b-eb9f9c39d6fc.mp4

---

## Benchmarks

In order to have an objective comparison of the performance of the inference across different system configurations,
use the [whisper-bench](examples/bench) tool. The tool simply runs the Encoder part of the model and prints how much time it
took to execute it. The results are summarized in the following Github issue:

[Benchmark results](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/89)

Additionally a script to run whisper.cpp with different models and audio files is provided [bench.py](scripts/bench.py).

You can run it with the following command, by default it will run against any standard model in the models folder.

```bash
python3 scripts/bench.py -f samples/jfk.wav -t 2,4,8 -p 1,2
```

It is written in python with the intention of being easy to modify and extend for your benchmarking use case.

It outputs a csv file with the results of the benchmarking.

## `ggml` format

The original models are converted to a custom binary format. This allows to pack everything needed into a single file:

- model parameters
- mel filters
- vocabulary
- weights

You can download the converted models using the [models/download-ggml-model.sh](models/download-ggml-model.sh) script
or manually from here:
