# Java JNI bindings for Whisper

This package provides Java JNI bindings for whisper.cpp. They have been tested on:

  * <strike>Darwin (OS X) 12.6 on x64_64</strike>
  * Ubuntu on x86_64
  * Windows on x86_64

The "low level" bindings are in `WhisperCppJnaLibrary`. The most simple usage is as follows:

JNA will attempt to load the `whispercpp` shared library from:

- jna.library.path
- jna.platform.library
- ~/Library/Frameworks
- /Library/Frameworks
- /System/Library/Frameworks
- classpath

```java
import io.github.ggerganov.whispercpp.WhisperCpp;

public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WhisperCpp whisper = new WhisperCpp();
        // By default, models are loaded from ~/.cache/whisper/ and are usually named "ggml-${name}.bin"
        // or you can provide the absolute path to the model file.
        long context = whisper.initContext("base.en");
        try {
            var whisperParams = whisper.getFullDefaultParams(WhisperSamplingStrategy.WHISPER_SAMPLING_GREEDY);
            // custom configuration if required
            whisperParams.temperature_inc = 0f;
            
            var samples = readAudio(); // divide each value by 32767.0f
            whisper.fullTranscribe(whisperParams, samples);
            
            int segmentCount = whisper.getTextSegmentCount(context);
            for (int i = 0; i < segmentCount; i++) {
                String text = whisper.getTextSegment(context, i);
                System.out.println(segment.getText());
            }
        } finally {
             whisper.freeContext(context);
        }
     }
}
```

## Building & Testing

In order to build, you need to have the JDK 8 or higher installed. Run the tests with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp.git
cd whisper.cpp/bindings/java

./gradlew build
```

You need to have the `whisper` library in your [JNA library path](https://java-native-access.github.io/jna/4.2.1/com/sun/jna/NativeLibrary.html). On Windows the dll is included in the jar and you can update it:

```bash
copy /y ..\..\build\bin\Release\whisper.dll build\generated\resources\main\win32-x86-64\whisper.dll
```


## License

The license for the Java bindings is the same as the license for the rest of the whisper.cpp project, which is the MIT License. See the `LICENSE` file for more details.
