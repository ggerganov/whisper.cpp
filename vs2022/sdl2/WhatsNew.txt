This is a list of major changes in SDL's version history.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.24.0:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

General:
* New version numbering scheme, similar to GLib and Flatpak.
    * An even number in the minor version (second component) indicates a production-ready stable release such as 2.24.0, which would have been 2.0.24 under the old system.
      * The patchlevel (micro version, third component) indicates a bugfix-only update: for example, 2.24.1 would be a bugfix-only release to fix bugs in 2.24.0, without adding new features.
    * An odd number in the minor version indicates a prerelease such as 2.23.0. Stable distributions should not use these prereleases.
      * The patchlevel indicates successive prereleases, for example 2.23.1 and 2.23.2 would be prereleases during development of the SDL 2.24.0 stable release.
